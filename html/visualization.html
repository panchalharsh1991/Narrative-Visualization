  <h1 align="left">Structure of Visualization</h1>
  
  <p>This narrative visualization uses a hybrid structure and consists of scenes,
    annotations, parameters, and triggers</p>

  <h2>Hybrid Structure</h2>
  This narrative visualization follows a "martini glass" structure consisting of four author-driven
  scenes followed by a final scene in which the reader is allowed to explore the dataset.

  <h2>Scenes</h2>
  The four author-driven scenes follow an identical layout. The intent is to draw reader attention to the
  chart and keep it there through transition from scene to scene. The position of elements is maintained across all scenes
  consistent to keep the reader oriented on the chart. Transitions are used between scenes to make the connection between
  scenes.

  <p>Scenes are navigated with page buttons at the top of the display which show the current scene
    and allows a readed to jump to different scenes in the story.</p>

  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  The common parameters for all scenes are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Scene number</b> - scenes are rendered in the same window, and scene number is a parameter
    that drives the presentation.</li>
    <li><b>Chart axis and sidebar text</b>- these elements are parameters that change based on the scene</li>
  </ul>

  Parameters that are specific to the author-driven portion (scenes 1-4) are: 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Annotation aiming point, position, text</b> - annotations are parameterized with an aiming point,
		a text offset and the content of the annotation</li>
  </ul>
 
  Parameters that are specific to the reader-drive portion (last scene):
  <ul>
    <li><b>Offense Type Selection</b> - The reader can select one of the offense to visualize data over hours of the day</li>
    <li><b>Sorted Data Checkbox</b> - The reader can use this checkbox to sort the data in descending order of frequency of the crime</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Triggers</h2>
  <p>The first trigger is the <b>completion of the HTML page load</b>, which invokes the routines to initialize the visualization and introduction scene.</p>
  <p>This is followed by the preparing data for different charts from CSV file</p>

  <p>The user advances through the presentation by clicking scene numbers shown in the top left corner.</p>
  <p>On the reader-driven scene, selecting an offense type triggers chart to be updated with relevant data
	or selection of sorted data checkbox, sorts the data in descending order.</p>
  
  <h2>Annotations</h2>
  <p>Annotations are added with the data point in the narrative 
	to explain the significance of the data. It helps the reader to explain key points from the chart.</p>

  <p>Annotations for each scene are added at the start of the scene, and removed during transitions so that the reader is
    drawn to the new annotation and data point in the story.</p>
